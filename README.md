# Sentiment Analysis Project

Welcome to the **Sentiment Analysis Project** repository! This project aims to analyze the sentiment of movie reviews using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict whether a given movie review expresses a positive or negative sentiment based on the text of the review.

## Overview

The project uses a dataset of movie reviews and applies **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques to preprocess the data, followed by building a machine learning model to classify the sentiment of each review. This repository showcases the end-to-end process of data cleaning, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **IMDB Movie Reviews** dataset containing **50,000** reviews. The dataset consists of two columns:
- **Review**: The text of the movie review.
- **Sentiment**: The label indicating whether the review is positive (`1`) or negative (`0`).

### Dataset Overview:
- 25,000 positive reviews
- 25,000 negative reviews

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries**:
  - Scikit-learn
  - NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
  - TensorFlow / Keras
- **Data Processing Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
- **Visualization**:
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks, Git

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SyedSubhan12/SentimentAnalysisProject.git
   cd SentimentAnalysisProject
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Preprocess the data:
   - Run the `data_preprocessing.py` script located in the `src` directory to clean and prepare the data for training:
   ```bash
   python src/data_preprocessing.py
   ```

4. Train the model:
   - Run the `train_model.py` script to train the sentiment analysis model:
   ```bash
   python src/train_model.py
   ```

5. Evaluate the model:
   - Run the evaluation script to test the model on the validation set and check performance metrics:
   ```bash
   python src/evaluate_model.py
   ```

6. Alternatively, you can explore and run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory for an interactive analysis:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualizations of the model's performance on the test set are included in the `results/` directory.

- **Accuracy**: Achieved **XX%** on the test set.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Shows the model’s prediction distribution.
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**: Provides a detailed evaluation of the positive and negative sentiment classification.
